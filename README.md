# Super App Example

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the latest version of `node` and `yarn` installed on your system. Please note that this project uses `yarn@3.x.x`, and not the classic version.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (including pods):

   ```sh
   yarn bootstrap
   ```

### Running the app

1. Start the dev servers

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

2. Run the host-app on `ios` or `android`:

   ```sh
   yarn run:host-app:ios
   # or
   yarn run:host-app:android
   ```
